## Got a Question or Problem?

Please feel free to use the contact form to ask any questions.

GitHub issues are only for [reporting bugs](#found-an-issue) and [feature requests](#want-a-feature), not
questions or help.

## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by
submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

When submitting an issue please include the following information:

- A description of the issue
- The JSON, classes, and code related to the issue
- The exception message and stacktrace if an error was thrown
- If possible, please include code that reproduces the issue. [DropBox][dropbox] or GitHub's
  [Gist][gist] can be used to share large code samples, or you could
  [submit a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with the issue reproduced in a new test.

The more information you include about the issue, the more likely it is to be fixed!

## Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository][github]. Before
requesting a feature consider the following:

- Stability is important.  Features that require large breaking changes are unlikely to be accepted

## Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request to the [GitHub Repository][github] make sure to do the following:

- Check that new and updated code follows existing code formatting and naming standard
- Run unit tests to ensure no existing functionality has been affected
- Write new unit tests to test your changes. All features and fixed bugs must have tests to verify
  they work

Read [GitHub Help][pullrequesthelp] for more details about creating pull requests.
